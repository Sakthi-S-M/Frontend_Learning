              I have the same border as my parent, but only because I have
              border: inherit applied to me. The border property is not normally
              inherited, but by using the inherit keyword, I was able to inherit
              all the border styles applied to my parent. The inherit keyword
              was applied to the shorthand property border as the only value.
